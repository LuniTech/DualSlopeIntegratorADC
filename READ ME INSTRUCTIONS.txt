Requires multisim 14.2 + 
Main designs in the root folder

Experimental schematics are usually stand alone and reflect my thought process as I am comming up with the final design. So you may find stand alone comparators etc.

Important simulation settings:
Click simulate --> Interactive simulation --> set initial conditions to zero!

The initial simulation conditions must be set to zero or the the op amps might not behave as expected!
